					<h2><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>
					<p>I am an aspiring developer with a strong academic foundation in Computer Science Engineering, currently in my 3rd year at RGPV University. My passion for technology and programming drives me to continuously learn and grow in this dynamic field.<br><br>

                        I have completed an AI and Data Science Remote Internship by IBM EDUNET FOUNDATION AICTE, where I gained hands-on experience in AI, data science, and cloud computing. I developed a chat bot on IBM Cloud and worked on various AI & ML experiments. Additionally, I participated in a one-day program at Indvibe Infotech Pvt. Ltd., where I learned about web and software development.<br><br>
                        
                        My technical skills include proficiency in Java, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind-CSS, and SQL. I have experience with backend development using Java, JavaScript, Servlet & JSP, Hibernate, and Spring Frameworks. I am also skilled in using software development tools like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse, and I am well-versed in version control with Git and GitHub.<br><br>
                        
                        I have worked on projects such as a Spending Tracker desktop application, which helps manage daily expenses, and a DN Chocolate web project, a user-friendly frontend project for selling chocolates. These projects have enhanced my debugging, troubleshooting, and object-oriented programming skills.<br><br>
                        
                        I am fluent in Hindi and English and am dedicated to leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute effectively to a collaborative software development team.</p>
